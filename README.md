# structures_webpage

Welcome! This webpage contains various interactive materials for the part of AERO50008 â€“ Structures 2 taught by Prof. Pinho, part of the [MEng in Aeronautics](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/study/ug/courses/) at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/). It is intended to be used together with the lecture notes (and other materials) prepared for the course. It is the result of extensive work involving several UROP and Student Shapers students, and you can find a full acknowledgement in the lecture notes.

The repo contains all of the files required for the interactive website for the Imperial College London, MEng Aeronautical Engineering, AERO50008 Structures 2 course for the 2020-21 academic year. This part of the course is delivered by Prof. Silvestre Pinho, and contains the topics of Overall Structural Analysis, Structural Dynamics, and a Vibrations Laboratory exercise.

The webiste can be downloaded and hosted without any file alterations, and is standalone without the need for additional modules or requirements.

This webiste was built by Benjamin Foster, during a StudentShapers undergraduate research project in the summer of 2020 - working with Prof Pinho, Qiying Deng, and Isaac Santos.

The website is a collection of pages that hosts the interactive widgets developed from previous StudentShapers projects, as well as other interactive materials for the course. The webiste style and layout is designed to match the lecture notes that are provided for the AERO50008 course. The website is built using Bootstrap 5 components and styling, with custom css on top.
